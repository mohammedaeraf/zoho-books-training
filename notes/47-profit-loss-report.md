### **11. Does P\&L Report consider Sales values or also takes into account Payment Recieved?**

The **Profit & Loss (P\&L) Report** in Zoho Books considers **Sales values** (i.e., invoices, credit notes, etc.) and **expenses**, not the actual **payment received**.

Hereâ€™s the difference:

* **Accrual Basis Accounting (default in Zoho Books)**

  * Sales are recorded when you create an invoice (regardless of whether payment is received).
  * Expenses are recorded when you create a bill (regardless of whether youâ€™ve paid it).
  * P\&L report reflects revenue and expenses from invoices/bills, not cash flow.

* **Cash Basis Accounting**

  * Sales are recorded only when payment is received.
  * Expenses are recorded only when bills are paid.
  * P\&L report reflects actual money movement.

**So in short:**

* By default, **P\&L considers Sales values**, not payment status.
* If you want it to consider only received payments, switch to **Cash Basis** in report filters.
