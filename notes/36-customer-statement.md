## **4. Understanding Statement Fields**

| **Field**           | **Meaning**                                                                                                                                                     |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Opening Balance** | Amount owed by customer at start of date range. This may differ from the original customer opening balance (because it’s carried forward from earlier periods). |
| **Transactions**    | Invoices, payments, credit notes in the selected date range.                                                                                                    |
| **Closing Balance** | Amount owed at the end of the selected period.                                                                                                                  |
| **Due Amount**      | Amount the customer still needs to pay as of the statement date.                                                                                                |

## **5. Classroom Tip – Linking to Practical Use**

- Before generating a statement, ensure all invoices and payments are up-to-date.
- Use **Outstanding Statement** for payment follow-ups.
- Use **Transaction Statement** for disputes or account reconciliation.

---

## **6. Common Mistakes to Avoid**

- **Confusing “Opening Balance” in Statement with Original Customer Opening Balance** – Remember, in statements, it’s the carry-forward balance.
- **Selecting wrong date range** – This can hide or miss transactions.
- **Not checking GST/VAT inclusion** – If you want tax to appear, ensure invoice templates are set to show it.

✅ **Quick Practice Idea:**
Have students create a customer, add:

- 1 opening balance,
- 2 invoices,
- 1 payment,
  Then generate both **Transaction** and **Outstanding Statements** to see how they differ.
