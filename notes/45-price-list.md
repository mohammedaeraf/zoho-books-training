## **Tutorial: Item Price List in Zoho Books**

### **1. What is a Price List?**

A **Price List** in Zoho Books lets you set special selling or purchasing prices for your items.
It is useful when:

* You want to give discounts to certain customers.
* You buy from suppliers who give you special rates.
* You want different pricing for different regions or seasons.

💡 Think of it like a **restaurant menu**—you have a fixed price list for your dishes, but you might have a *special menu* for VIP customers or seasonal offers.

### **8. Best Practices**

✅ Name Price Lists clearly (e.g., “Winter Sale 2025 – Sales”).
