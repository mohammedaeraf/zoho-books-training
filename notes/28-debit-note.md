## 📤 How to Apply a Debit Note to a Customer's Invoice

You **don’t** apply a debit note to an existing invoice like a credit note.

Instead, you:

* Use the **debit note to generate an additional charge**
* Send it to the customer
* Collect payment for it separately
  OR
* Include it in **statements** as outstanding dues

## 🧠 Tips for Using Debit Notes

* They’re **rarely used** compared to invoices and credit notes
* Ideal for **post-invoice pricing corrections**
