## 📘 What is **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)?**

**Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)** refers to the **direct cost** of producing or purchasing the goods that a business sells during a specific period.

It includes only the **cost directly tied to the items sold**, such as:

- Purchase price of raw materials or goods
- Freight charges (if directly related to procurement)
- Packaging (if part of product cost)

COGS **does not** include:

- Marketing expenses
- Office rent
- Admin salaries

### ✅ Formula for COGS (Simple)

**COGS = Opening Inventory + Purchases – Closing Inventory**

---

### 🔍 Example:

| Particular                 | Amount  |
| -------------------------- | ------- |
| Opening Inventory          | ₹10,000 |
| Add: Purchases during year | ₹30,000 |
| Less: Closing Inventory    | ₹8,000  |
| 👉 **COGS**                | ₹32,000 |

So ₹32,000 is the cost of items you **actually sold** during the year.

## 🧠 Why is COGS Important?

  > **Gross Profit = Sales – COGS**
