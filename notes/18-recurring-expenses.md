# 🔁 Tutorial: **Recurring Expenses in Zoho Books**

---

## ✅ What is a Recurring Expense?

A **Recurring Expense** is an expense that happens on a regular basis — daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly — and can be **automatically recorded** in Zoho Books.

It’s useful for:

* **Office Rent**
* **Internet Bills**
* **Software Subscriptions** (e.g., Canva, Zoom)
* **Utility Bills**

Rather than entering the same expense every month, you can set it up once and let Zoho Books take care of the rest!
