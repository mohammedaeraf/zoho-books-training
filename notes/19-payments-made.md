### ✅ What is "Payments Made"?

**Payments Made** refers to any **outflow of money** from your business to a vendor, consultant, or service provider.

It is used to **record payments against:**

* **Bills** you've created for a vendor
* **Vendor Credits** (adjusted against payments)
* **Direct expenses** (if paid immediately)

## 🧭 Where to Find It

From the left sidebar, go to:
**Purchases → Payments Made**

## 🛠️ How to Record a Payment

---

> Example:
> Bill Amount = ₹5,000
> Vendor Credit = ₹1,000
> Payment to be made = ₹4,000
