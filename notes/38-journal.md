# **Tutorial: Journal in Zoho Books**

## **1. What is a Journal Entry?**

In Zoho Books, a **Journal Entry** is a manual accounting transaction used to record **debits and credits** that aren’t automatically captured through other modules (like Invoices, Bills, or Payments).

It is often used for:

* Adjustments between accounts
* Opening balances
* Depreciation of assets
* Correcting errors in past transactions
* Recording accruals or prepayments

## **2. When to Use a Journal**

Use a journal in Zoho Books when:

* You want to record transactions **without involving customers or vendors** directly.
* You need to adjust your accounting balances manually.
* You have **double-entry bookkeeping knowledge** (since journals affect multiple accounts simultaneously).
