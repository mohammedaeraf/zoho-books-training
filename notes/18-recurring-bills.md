# 📘 Tutorial: **Recurring Bills in Zoho Books**

---

## ✅ What Are Recurring Bills?

A **Recurring Bill** in Zoho Books is a bill that is automatically created on a scheduled basis — **weekly, monthly, quarterly**, etc.

This is helpful for:

* Internet or utility bills
* Office rent
* Software subscriptions
* Any **repeat purchase or vendor payment**

Instead of creating a new bill every time, Zoho Books can **generate it automatically**.

## 🧠 When to Use Recurring Bills?

Use Recurring Bills when:

* You pay the **same vendor** regularly
* The **bill amount is fixed or nearly fixed**
* You want to save time and avoid manual entries
