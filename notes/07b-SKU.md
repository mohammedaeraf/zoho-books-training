## Should SKU be different for same product (32GB Pen Drive) from different brands?

Yes, **SKU should be different** for the **same product type** (e.g., 32GB Pen Drive) from **different brands**.

---

### ‚úÖ Why?

**SKU (Stock Keeping Unit)** is meant to be a **unique internal code** that helps you:

- Track individual product variations
- Identify products by brand, model, color, size, etc.
- Avoid confusion during billing, stock updates, or reporting

---

### üß† Example:

Let‚Äôs say you sell two 32GB pen drives from different brands:

| Product Name             | Brand   | Suggested SKU |
| ------------------------ | ------- | ------------- |
| 32GB Pen Drive ‚Äì SanDisk | SanDisk | `PD32-SND`    |
| 32GB Pen Drive ‚Äì HP      | HP      | `PD32-HP`     |
| 32GB Pen Drive ‚Äì Sony    | Sony    | `PD32-SNY`    |

> Even though all are 32GB, their brand makes them **different items** for pricing, warranty, or purchase reasons.

---

### üìå Tip:

Design SKUs based on your preferred logic.
You can include:

- Product type (e.g., `PD` for Pen Drive)
- Size (e.g., `32`)
- Brand short code (e.g., `SND`, `HP`, `SNY`)
