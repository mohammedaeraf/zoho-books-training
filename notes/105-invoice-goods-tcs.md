## ‚úÖ **TCS on Sale of Goods ‚Äì Section 206C(1H)**

As per **Section 206C(1H)** of the Income Tax Act:

TCS is applicable on **sale of goods** if the following conditions are met:

| Criteria                         | Condition                                         |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Seller's turnover in previous FY | **Exceeds ‚Çπ10 crore**                             |
| Sale of goods to a buyer         | Aggregate value **exceeds ‚Çπ50 lakh** in a FY      |
| TCS to be collected on           | Amount **exceeding ‚Çπ50 lakh**                     |
| TCS rate                         | **0.1%** (if PAN is available) or **1%** (if not) |

## üõ† TCS in Zoho Books

You can configure TCS in Zoho Books:

### ‚û§ How to Enable TCS in Zoho Books:

1. Go to `Settings ‚Üí Taxes ‚Üí TCS`
2. Click on **+ New TCS**
3. Enter:

   * **Tax Name** (e.g., TCS on Sale of Goods)
   * **Rate** (e.g., 0.1%)
   * **Effective From** date
4. Assign this TCS rate to specific **items** or **customers**

During invoice creation, Zoho will calculate TCS accordingly.

---

## üß™ Example

You run a business with ‚Çπ15 crore turnover.
Customer A has already purchased goods worth ‚Çπ52 lakh this year.
Now, you raise an invoice for ‚Çπ10 lakh more.

* TCS will be calculated on ‚Çπ10 lakh (i.e., the amount exceeding ‚Çπ50 lakh).
* TCS @ 0.1% = ‚Çπ1,000

So invoice total = ‚Çπ10,00,000 + ‚Çπ1,000 = ‚Çπ10,01,000
