üí° *Example:*
If Output GST = ‚Çπ50,000 and ITC = ‚Çπ30,000 ‚Üí GST Payable = ‚Çπ20,000.

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Step 3: Understanding Zoho Books‚Äô Calculation**

Zoho Books automatically:

1. **Adds up Output Tax** from all sales invoices in the period.

3. **Adjusts Output Tax with ITC**:

   * **If Output Tax > ITC** ‚Üí Pay the difference.

üìå Formula:

```
GST Payable = Output Tax ‚Äì ITC
```

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ **Step 4: Example Calculation**

**Sales:**

* Invoice 1: ‚Çπ1,00,000 + GST (18%) = ‚Çπ18,000
* Invoice 2: ‚Çπ50,000 + GST (18%) = ‚Çπ9,000
  **Total Output Tax:** ‚Çπ27,000

**Purchases:**

* Bill 1: ‚Çπ40,000 + GST (18%) = ‚Çπ7,200
* Bill 2: ‚Çπ30,000 + GST (18%) = ‚Çπ5,400
  **Total ITC:** ‚Çπ12,600

**Calculation:**

```
Output Tax = ‚Çπ27,000
ITC = ‚Çπ12,600
Net GST Payable = ‚Çπ27,000 ‚Äì ‚Çπ12,600 = ‚Çπ14,400
```
