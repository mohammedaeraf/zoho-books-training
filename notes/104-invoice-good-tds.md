### 💡 **Short Answer:**

**No**, **TDS (Tax Deducted at Source)** is **generally NOT applicable** when you are issuing an **invoice for sale of goods**.

---

## ✅ When is TDS Applicable?

TDS is **mainly applicable on payments for services**, **rent**, **professional fees**, **contract work**, **interest**, etc. as per **Income Tax Act, 1961**. It is **not typically applicable** to **sale of goods**, except in one specific case (explained below).

## ⚠️ Exception: Section 194Q (Applicable in Certain Goods Sales)

**From 1st July 2021**, **Section 194Q** introduced **TDS on purchase of goods** if **ALL** the following apply:

| Condition                                  | Threshold                            |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| Buyer’s turnover in previous FY            | Exceeds ₹10 crore                    |
| Value of goods purchased from seller in FY | Exceeds ₹50 lakh                     |
| Transaction type                           | Purchase of **goods** (not services) |
| TDS rate                                   | 0.1% (on amount exceeding ₹50 lakh)  |

> 🧠 **Note**: In this case, the **buyer** deducts TDS and deposits it to the government, not the seller.

## 🔍 So, in Your Case (Selling Goods):

| Scenario                        | TDS Applicable?               |

| You provide consulting services | ✅ YES (if threshold crossed)  |
| Buyer is liable under 194Q      | ✅ YES (but buyer deducts TDS) |
