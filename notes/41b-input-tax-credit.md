## **What is ITC (Input Tax Credit)?**

**ITC** means the **GST you paid on purchases** can be **adjusted against the GST you collect on sales**.
You only pay GST to the government on the **value you add**, not on the full sale amount.

## **Your Scenario Explained**

### **Step 1: Purchase (Input)**

You buy **Perfume Oil** for **₹20,000**.

* GST @ 18% = **₹3,600** → **[A]**
* This ₹3,600 is called **Input Tax**
* This amount becomes your **Input Tax Credit (ITC)**

👉 You already paid this GST to your supplier.

### **Step 2: Sale (Output)**

You sell **Branded Perfumes** for **₹50,000**.

* GST @ 18% = **₹9,000** → **[B]**
* This ₹9,000 is called **Output Tax**
* You collect this GST from your customer.

---

### **Step 3: Adjust ITC (Set-off)**

While filing GST return:

* Output GST = **₹9,000 [B]**
* Less: ITC available = **₹3,600 [A]**

### **GST payable to Government**

**₹9,000 − ₹3,600 = ₹5,400**

---

## **What actually goes to the Government?**

You do **not** pay ₹9,000 again.

* ₹3,600 → already paid earlier (as ITC)
* ₹5,400 → paid now while filing return

So the government finally receives **only ₹5,400**, which is GST on your **value addition**.

---

## **Simple Definition**

> **ITC is the GST paid on purchases that can be deducted from GST payable on sales.**

## **One-line Summary**

✔ Prevents **double taxation**
✔ Encourages **proper billing**
✔ Tax is paid only on **value added**
