## 📘 Tutorial: Vendor Credits in Zoho Books

### ✅ What is a Vendor Credit?

A **Vendor Credit** is issued by a vendor when:

- You return goods after purchasing them
- You've been **overcharged** or **billed in error**
- You cancel part of a service and are owed a refund or adjustment

In Zoho Books, Vendor Credits are used to **record these refunds** or **adjustments**, and can be **applied to future bills**.

## 🧾 How Vendor Credits Are Used

Once recorded, Vendor Credits can be:

### ✅ Applied to a Bill

- When you create a new **Bill** for that vendor, Zoho Books will show **available credits**
- You can **apply the credit** to reduce the amount payable

> For example:
> Bill Total = ₹1,000
> Vendor Credit = ₹100
> ✅ You pay only ₹900

---

### ✅ Refunded (Optional)

- If the vendor gives you a **cash refund** instead of applying it to another bill:

  - Go to the **Vendor Credit**
  - Click **More → Record Refund**
  - Enter the amount and payment mode

---

### 📊 Where to Track Vendor Credits

- Go to **Reports → Payables → Vendor Credits Summary**
- You’ll see:

  - Vendor-wise credits
  - Amount available
  - Amount applied

## 🎯 Best Practices

- Always tie a Vendor Credit to a **specific return or adjustment**
- Record it **as soon as the return is accepted** or overcharge confirmed
- Use it when creating the next bill to **reduce your payable amount**
