## ✅ What is a Purchase Workflow?

The **Purchase Workflow** in Zoho Books refers to the process of managing and recording your business’s purchases — from ordering goods or services to making payment to vendors and updating inventory.

It helps in:

* Keeping accurate expense records
* Managing inventory stock
* Ensuring vendor accountability
* Avoiding duplicate purchases

---

## 🔁 Complete Steps in the Purchase Workflow

---

### 🔹 Step 1: **Add a Vendor**

Before you begin purchasing, you need to add the supplier or vendor.

**Go to:**
📍 `Purchases → Vendors → + New`

**Details to fill:**

* Vendor Name
* Email (optional)
* Payment Terms (e.g., Net 15)
* GSTIN (if applicable)
* Custom Fields (e.g., Vendor Category)

---

### 🔹 Step 2: **Enable Inventory Tracking** *(Optional)*

If you deal with goods, enable inventory tracking for automatic stock updates.

**Go to:**
📍 `Items → Settings → Enable Inventory Tracking`

---

### 🔹 Step 3: **Add Items or Services**

**Go to:**
📍 `Items → + New`

Fill in:

* Item Name
* Type: Goods / Service
* Purchase Price
* Expense Account (for services)
* Enable inventory tracking (for goods)
* Reorder Point (optional)

---

### 🔹 Step 4: **Create a Purchase Order (PO)**

A **Purchase Order** is a formal order you send to a vendor requesting specific goods or services.

**Go to:**
📍 `Purchases → Purchase Orders → + New`

Fill in:

* Vendor
* PO Date
* Items and Quantities
* Tax (e.g., CGST/SGST/IGST)
* Notes/Terms if needed

📌 You can **email, print, or download** the PO.

---

### 🔹 Step 5: **Mark the PO as Issued or Received**

* Once PO is confirmed with vendor, mark it as **Issued**
* After receiving goods/services, mark it as **Received**

✔️ If Inventory is enabled, stock gets updated only after marking as **Received**

---

### 🔹 Step 6: **Convert PO to Bill**

After delivery, convert the PO into a **Bill**.

**Click:**
📍 `Purchase Orders → More → Convert to Bill`

A Bill represents the amount payable to the vendor.

Fill in:

* Bill Date
* Due Date (based on payment terms)
* Reference number (from vendor’s invoice)

---

### 🔹 Step 7: **Record Payment**

When you pay the vendor, record it in the system.

**Go to:**
📍 `Purchases → Bills → Open Bill → Record Payment`

Fill in:

* Amount paid
* Date
* Payment mode (Bank, UPI, Cash)

---

### 🔹 Step 8: **View Reports**

To review purchases:

* 📍 `Reports → Purchases by Vendor`
* 📍 `Reports → Bills by Status`
* 📍 `Reports → Purchases by Item`
