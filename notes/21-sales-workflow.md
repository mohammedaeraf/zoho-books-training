## 🧾 What is a **Sales Order** in Zoho Books?

A **Sales Order** is a **confirmation document** sent to a customer **before** delivering goods or services.
It’s created **after a Quote is accepted** and **before an Invoice is issued**.

### 📌 Key Uses:

* Confirm product availability
* Reserve stock (if inventory is enabled)
* Serve as internal instruction for the dispatch/shipping team
* Acts as a formal commitment to fulfill a customer's order

---

### 🧠 When to Use a Sales Order?

Use it when:

* You need to confirm an order before fulfillment
* You want internal approval before billing
* You're handling **physical goods and stock**

In service-based businesses, **Sales Orders are often skipped**, and quotes are converted directly to invoices.
