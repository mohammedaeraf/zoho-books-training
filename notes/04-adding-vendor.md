### 📘 What is **Opening Balance** in a Vendor (Zoho Books)?

**Opening Balance** for a Vendor refers to the amount **you owe** to that vendor **as of the date you start using Zoho Books**.

### ✅ Example to Understand:

Let’s say you started using Zoho Books on **1st April 2025**, and before that, you had already **purchased goods worth ₹10,000** from a vendor called **ABC Suppliers**, but haven't paid yet.

* In this case, you owe ₹10,000 to ABC Suppliers.
* So, when adding this vendor in Zoho Books, you will enter ₹10,000 as the **Opening Balance**.
