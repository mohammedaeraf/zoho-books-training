### ✅ What is an Expense in Zoho Books?

An **Expense** in Zoho Books refers to **any payment your business makes** that is not associated with a bill from a vendor. It helps track operational costs such as:

* Travel
* Meals
* Rent
* Utility bills
* Software subscriptions

> 🧾 Unlike a Bill (which is usually received from a vendor and paid later), an **Expense is often recorded at the time of payment**.
