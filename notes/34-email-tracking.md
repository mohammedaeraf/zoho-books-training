## ✅ What is Email Tracking in Zoho Books?

**Email tracking** allows you to:

## 🛠️ How to Enable Email Tracking

### 🔹 Step 1: Go to Email Preferences

2. Click the **gear icon (⚙️)** in the top-right corner
3. Go to **Preferences**

### 🔹 Step 2: Enable Email Insights (Tracking)

Under the **Email** preferences section:

  ```
  ✅ Track email delivery and open status
  ```

## 📬 What Email Tracking Shows

For each email sent (like an invoice or quote), you’ll see a **status** in the respective module’s transaction page.

### 🔎 Where to See Email Status

* Go to any **Invoice**, **Estimate**, or **Sales Order**
* Scroll down to the **Comments & History** section

You’ll see entries like:

| Status             | Meaning                           |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| **Email Sent**     | Email was successfully sent       |
| **Delivered**      | Email reached the recipient       |
| **Opened**         | Email was opened by the recipient |
| **Bounced**        | Email failed to deliver           |
| **Marked as Spam** | Email was flagged by recipient    |

---

## 🧠 Notes & Tips

* **Open tracking** relies on a small invisible tracking pixel. If your customer disables image loading, the **open status may not show**.
* If using **custom SMTP** (your own email server), tracking might be **limited**.
* Always **verify email addresses** to reduce bounce rates.
* Combine tracking with **email reminders** for better follow-ups.

## 🚀 Best Practices

* ✔️ Use professional and clear subject lines
* ✔️ Customize email templates with your branding
* ✔️ Check the email log regularly to track activity
* ❌ Avoid sending attachments with very large file sizes
