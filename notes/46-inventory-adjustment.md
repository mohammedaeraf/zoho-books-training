## **Tutorial: Inventory Adjustment in Zoho Books**

### **1. Introduction**

Inventory adjustment is the process of correcting the quantity or value of items in your stock.
You use it when:

- Stock physically counted is different from stock in the system.
- Items are damaged, expired, lost, or misplaced.
- You receive extra items that weren’t recorded.
- You want to correct cost price changes for accounting.

---

### **2. When to Use Inventory Adjustment**

- **Stock Take Differences:** You counted 48 units, but Zoho Books shows 50.
- **Damaged or Expired Goods:** A batch of milk packets expired and must be removed from stock.
- **Found Stock:** You discover 5 units that were missed in earlier entries.
- **Price Correction:** Supplier revised the cost after you recorded the purchase.

### **6. Creating a Value Adjustment**

1. Choose **Value Adjustment**.
2. Select **Item**.
3. Update the **New Rate/Value**.
4. Zoho Books will adjust total stock value while keeping quantity unchanged.

**Example:**

- Item: Rice Bag (25 kg)
- Quantity: 20
- Old Rate: ₹1,000 per bag
- New Rate: ₹1,050 per bag (due to supplier rate change).

---

### **7. Reviewing the Adjustment**

- After saving, the adjustment will:

  - Update stock reports.
  - Reflect in **Inventory Summary** and **Stock Valuation** reports.

- The change is recorded in **Audit Trail** for transparency.
