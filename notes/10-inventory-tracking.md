* When you record a **bill** or **purchase order**, inventory increases

### Sales

* When you create an **invoice** or **sales order**, inventory decreases

### Example:

* Opening stock = 10 units of USB Drives
* Purchase 5 more ‚Üí Total = 15
* Sell 3 units ‚Üí Remaining stock = 12

Zoho Books updates this **automatically**.
