# üßæ **Beginner's Guide to GST (Goods and Services Tax)**

---

## ‚úÖ **1. What is GST?**

**GST (Goods and Services Tax)** is a **tax you pay on almost everything you buy or sell** ‚Äî like products, services, meals, or clothes.

It is a **single, unified tax** that replaced older taxes like:

* VAT (Value Added Tax)
* Service Tax
* Excise Duty

### üí° Imagine this:

Earlier, different taxes were applied at different levels (by state and central government). Now, GST has **replaced all of them with one simple tax system** across India.

## ‚úÖ **2. Why was GST Introduced?**

GST was introduced in **India on July 1st, 2017** to:

* Simplify the tax structure üßæ
* Avoid double taxation üîÑ
* Make business easier üöÄ
* Bring transparency and accountability üîç

## ‚úÖ **3. How Does GST Work?**

Every product or service you sell has a **price + GST**.
For example:

* You sell a product for ‚Çπ1,000
* GST is 18%
* Your customer pays: ‚Çπ1,000 + ‚Çπ180 = ‚Çπ1,180

This ‚Çπ180 GST is collected by you and **paid to the government**.

## ‚úÖ **4. Types of GST**

Depending on where the buyer and seller are located, GST is divided into:

| Type                      | Used When              | Who Gets the Tax?          |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------- | -------------------------- |
| **CGST** ‚Äì Central GST    | Sale within same state | Central Govt               |

| **IGST** ‚Äì Integrated GST | Sale between states    | Central Govt (then shared) |

**Example 1:** You sell from Karnataka to Karnataka ‚Üí CGST + SGST
