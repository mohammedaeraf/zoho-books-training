# **Cash Flow Report**

A **Cash Flow Report** is a financial statement that shows the **movement of money in and out of a business** during a specific period.

> ‚ÄúWhere did our money come from, and where did it go?‚Äù

## **Purpose**

* Helps track **liquidity** (how much cash the business has available).
* Shows whether the company has enough cash to cover expenses and investments.
* Helps spot cash shortages before they become a problem.

## **Key Sections**

1. **Cash Inflows** (Money coming in)

   * Customer payments for sales
   * Loan proceeds
   * Owner‚Äôs investment
   * Other income

2. **Cash Outflows** (Money going out)

   * Payments to suppliers/vendors
   * Salaries and wages
   * Rent, utilities, and operating expenses
   * Loan repayments
   * Purchase of assets

3. **Net Cash Flow**

   * **Positive Net Cash Flow** ‚Üí More cash came in than went out (good sign for liquidity).
   * **Negative Net Cash Flow** ‚Üí More cash went out than came in (may signal a problem or heavy investment period).

## **Real-Life Example**

Imagine your business as a **water tank**:

* The **water flowing in** is your cash inflows.
* The **water flowing out** is your cash outflows.
* The **water level** in the tank is your available cash balance.

If more water flows in than out ‚Üí tank level rises (healthy cash position).
If more water flows out than in ‚Üí tank level drops (risk of running dry).
