## ✅ Benefits of Creating a Vendor for Subscriptions (e.g., "Canva")

### 1. **Improved Tracking by Vendor**

* You can easily see **how much you’ve paid Canva** over time.
* Use **Reports → Expenses by Vendor** to filter all payments made to "Canva".

### 2. **Simplifies Recurring Expense Management**

* You can **set up recurring expenses** tied to Canva.
* This ensures consistency (e.g., same amount, account, and vendor every month).

### 3. **Better Audit Trail**

* If someone audits your books or you review expenses, having "Canva" as the vendor clearly shows:

  * What service you paid for
  * When and how much
  * Consistency in payments

### 4. **Vendor-wise Payment History**

* Go to **Purchases → Vendors → Canva**
* See **all past payments**, expense records, and reference numbers in one place.

### 5. **Helps with Budgeting & Cost Control**

* Over time, you'll know how much you're spending on design tools, software subscriptions, etc.
* Makes it easier to analyze total software expenses by vendor.
